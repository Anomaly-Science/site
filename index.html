    <hr>
    <p>Anomaly Science is here to redefine what it means to create. We are here to deviates from what is standard, normal, or expected in the world of STEM, and build a better future for makers. We make it possible to bring any idea to life. <br><br> We are still in our early stages, currently based out of Cincinnati, with fully-online operations. First round of projects starting soon.
